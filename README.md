# Aim: To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation

### Algorithm: 

1] Select a base scene for AI video generation.

2] Apply Zero-shot prompting to generate the first version.

3] Apply Few-shot prompting using image/video references.

4] Use Chain-of-thought prompting to create a step-wise transformation video.

5] Use Role-based prompting to re-imagine the scene from a specific creative perspective.

6] Compare the outputs visually and analyze how each prompting technique influences the final video.

7] Document observations and conclusions.

## Procedure:

### Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models  

We researched the following models/tools for video generation:

| Model         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Runway Gen-2** | A powerful text-to-video model allowing cinematic and realistic generation. Supports short clips with motion and camera control. |
| **Synthesia**    | Avatar-based AI video generator used for corporate presentations and voiceovers. |
| **Pictory**      | Converts long-form content into short videos using summarized prompts. Great for highlights or explainer videos. |
| **DeepBrain**    | Realistic AI avatar and presenter-based video generator with language and tone control. |

### Step 2: Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation  

**Example Prompt 1:**  
> "A person walking in a park."  

This prompt was used in Runway Gen-2 to observe basic character motion and scene rendering.

---

### Step 3: Experiment with More Detailed Prompts  

**Example Prompt 2:**  
> "A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them."

Adding color, background action, lighting, and companions gave the model more context and produced richer visuals.

---

### Step 4: Add Time and Motion Elements  

**Example Prompt 3:**  
> "A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky."

Time-based and camera motion elements were well understood by Runway Gen-2, resulting in dynamic cinematic effects.

---

### Step 5: Test Different Video Styles  

**Example Prompt 4:**  
> "An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people."

This prompt was tested in both Runway Gen-2 and Synthesia (with background visuals), demonstrating stylistic diversity.

---

### Step 6: Iterate and Adjust Prompts  

**Refined Prompt Example:**  
> "A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street, dynamic camera panning, and a high-speed chase scene."

The adjusted prompt resulted in more detailed motion, lighting, and better story coherence.

---

### Step 7: Generate Multiple Versions  

We tested variations such as:

- "A high-speed car chase in a rainy futuristic city."
- "A sports car drifting through neon streets at night under glowing billboards."

These generated different visual pacing and effects, useful for creative direction decisions.

---

### Step 8: Save and Compare Outputs  

All outputs were saved, timestamped, and labeled. A comparison matrix was created to analyze differences in lighting, movement, and realism.

### Concept Title:
🎃 Concept Title:“Algorithmic Arboretum — Exploring Prompting Techniques in Object Transformation using an Apple Base”

### Core Video Concept (Use Case for Experiment):
A simple, photorealistic red apple is used as the base object on a presentation slide. Over several seconds, the video demonstrates the apple transforming into different artistic and abstract styles based on the application of various prompting techniques (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, or specific style prompts). The experiment visually showcases how different prompt styles fundamentally alter the texture, material, composition, and visual concept of the object while maintaining its core shape.

### Master Prompt (for creating the video):

You can use this with any image/video-generation AI model (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Ideogram, etc.)

### ✅  Tool-Specific Prompts:

#### ► Runway Gen-2 Prompt
```
“Transform this base street-walk clip into 4 styles: dreamy cinematic, cyberpunk-watercolor hybrid, stepwise evolving transformation, and sci-fi director’s reimagining.”
```
#### ► Pika Labs Prompt
```
“Take the original walking footage and generate four contrasting styles using zero-shot, few-shot references, step-by-step visual evolution, and director-style sci-fi action.”
```
#### ► Luma Dream Machine Prompt
```
“Recreate the same walking scene in cinematic, artistic hybrid, progressive transformation, and sci-fi director modes.”
```
#### ► Krea Video Prompt
```
“Apply four prompt methods—zero-shot, reference blending, chained transformation, and role-based directing—on the same simple walking clip.”
```
### 🎥 Main Prompt Text:
```
Zero-Shot Style: A simple, smooth, reflective chrome sphere sitting on the same table, perfectly capturing the light of the environment.

Few-Shot/Referenced Style: The apple is transformed into a highly intricate, glass/crystal sphere with internal luminescence and complex refractive patterns, matching the style of a 'digital art installation.'

Chain-of-Thought/Step-wise Style: The apple undergoes a progressive deconstruction, transforming into a jagged, technological artifact made of shredded metallic paper and wires, scattering fragments on the surface.

Role-Based/Abstract Style: The final state is an abstract, hyper-detailed, and organic mass of microscopic fibers and spores, following the style of a 'biopunk designer.' All transformations must maintain the original object's location and base lighting setup. The final output is a presentation slide showing the prompt text and the resulting image transformation.”
```
### Observation Table:

| Prompting Technique | Description of Output                         | Strengths                 | Weaknesses              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Zero-shot           | Basic transformation without examples         | Fast, simple              | Less controlled         |
| Few-shot            | Style matches reference images/videos         | High accuracy, consistent | Needs reference data    |
| Chain-of-thought    | Gradual evolution in steps                    | Detailed control          | Longer generation       |
| Role-based          | Follows creative persona (director, animator) | Rich creativity           | Sometimes unpredictable |

### Result: 

Different prompting techniques produced distinct video outputs even when using the same base scene. Zero-shot gave simple changes, few-shot provided style accuracy, chain-of-thought gave stepwise control, and role-based produced highly creative variations.
